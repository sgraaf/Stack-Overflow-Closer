# Stack Overflow Closer

A very simple Firefox ü¶ä browser extension that closes every open Stack Overflow tab with a single click. Extremely useful for developers who open multiple Stack Overflow tabs when trying to find the answer to a question or fix a Bug üêõ, and need a quick way out once they're done.

Looking for Google Chrome instead? Check out [CloseStackOverflow](https://github.com/davidvos/CloseStackOverflow), which is also available through the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/close-all-stack-overflow/doiooledckdcghpcbgdfbbohekpgiokl).
